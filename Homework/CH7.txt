1) class is a classification where you systematically arrange information and behavior into a meaningful entity.
 is also a type.

2) the two purposes of encapsulation are to combine methods and data within a class; in other words to support classificatiom
 and the second is to control the accessibility of the methods and data; in other words, to control the use of the class. 

3) new keyword instantiates the class-- goes to heap and allocates enough memory for the type than stores the address in the variable.

4) private is the defualt access for fields and methods of a class. to change it from default write the key word public before its declaration

5) public circle()

6) class fields and methods store data that is shared by all instances. declare class followed by the name

7) you would bring a static class in scope by calling it by name you would do this to use the class 

8) it may be good to use anonymous class for sevurity reason or to keep user data private. 
 anonymous class is an unnamed user class that the compiler creates a name for and doesn't tell the user.

9)polymorphism as used in computer science means behavior varies depending on the type of the variable 

10) message passing is the way we think of objects communicating.
 Tells the outcome desired but not how to do it.

11) simula is the first object-oriented programming language

12) alexander stephanov is the primary designer and implementer of the c++ standard template library
