1) true or false

2)==(equality) !=(inequality). < <= >= >. &&(both) ||(if eithier). all re used in boolean expressions and return a true or false. differ in that the values
the operate on must also be true or false 

3) its when an expression can be evaluated to true or false without the entire code having to run

4) for &&(conditional and) if it returns fales in the  first parameter and ||(condtional or)
 if it returns true in the first parameter
 
5)primary ()-precedence override ++postinc --postdec, assignment

6)run the code within if statement is called and groups together and runs all code if more than one line is wanted

7) all code from the matched case label to the end of the switch statement will run

8) switch key word to iniate code, case is label to compare expressions, break stops the code 
and returns control to outside code, default is the optional code if nothing reutrns true

9) recurr2() returns 2 values the calculation and the value counting down, 
recur1 does not return the calculation til the end // internally the compiler turns recurr2 into an interation statement
(saves memory)

10) method that calls itself until our starting number reaches our desired ending number
its when you alter a number and check its value  and continue to do that untill you return the desired value

11) both equate to the same value true for both  / true to var1 and true to var2
