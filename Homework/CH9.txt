1) A enum or enumeration is values limited to a set of symbolic names

2) enum Ranks { Private, specialist, sergeant, sergeant first class, master sgt firstsgt, sgm, csgm}

3) Ranks Ethan = Ranks.sergeant; Ranks cline = Ranks.specialist;

4)  console.writeline((int)cline);

5) to select type of a enum use : followed by type 
enum example : long { a, b, c}

6) a struct is a value type stored on the stack.

7) classes define refrences that are created on the heap vs struck being on the stack, struck cannot have a default 
constructor, struck sets defualt fields to 0, false, null. classes can initilize instance fields structs cannot

8) structs are stored on the stack 

9)Int32 Struct fields are minvalue, maxvalue. the methods are compareto, equals, gethash(or type)code, parse, tostring
tryparse and tryformat
10) struct Dod {Army, Marines, Navy, AirForce}

11) you cannot create a defualt constructor for a struct because the compiler auto generates a defualt constructor

12) CIL is the common intermediate language, its converts your code to pseudo-machine code stored on the assembly
the clr converts the cil intstructions into real machine instructions that the processor can understand
