1) an array in memory stays together contiguously(touching). 

2) memory is allocated on the heap for an array.

3) memory is allocated on the stack for an array reference.

4) the value type of what an array can hold is based on what value type you refrence when initilizing it
it is possible to refrence objects of different value types.

5) foreach (){code} foreach iterates throught the entire array, iterates 0 to length -1

6) to make a deep copy of an array you need to create a new array instance of the same type and length
then you need to copy the data from the original array can use arrayname.copyTo, new array{arrayname.length}/clone 

7)  the differnnce in syntax for multi-dimensional arrray is to add a second index value within the []
exp int[] items = new int [1,4]

8) the differnce between multi-dimensionalarrays and array of arrays is that array of arrays allow you to set the number
of columns per row instead of having a fixed amount. synatx use [][]

9) to flatten a multidimensional array you would need to 

10) foreach cannot change the value of the array elements inside the loop because
