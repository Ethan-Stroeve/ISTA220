1) Variable used within a method or statement block where it was declared. 
2) its a command that performs a action. 
3) Names that you use to identify the elements in your programs .
4) reserved identifiers used by C# that the user cannot use (is blue).
5) storage location that holds a value.
6) with a declaration statement, example int age; use = to assign value, No, yes.
7) Creates a new solution file, you can generate multiple soltion files and be coding in different ones.
8) What operators you can use depend on a variables type char, int, long, float, double, and decimal can use all string can use none except + 
   also the return value can depend on the variable type.
9) using ToString example intVar.ToString();
10) int.Parse method
11) precedence is which operator is calculated first for example * would be calculated before + this is different 
    from associativity which decides which operation is used when the have the same precedence, this is done by reading the text left to right. 4*8/3+2 
12) you must assign a value to a variable before you use it otherwise the program does not compile.
13) the value returned by a postfix will be the value before the increment or decrement took place if you use a prefix the value will be changed based on the increment or decrement.
14) allows user to use $ and {} to evalute any expression within {} in a string, this is more effcient while compiling compared to using +
15) has the C# complier infer the type of variable from an expression.
